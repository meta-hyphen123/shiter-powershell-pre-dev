<p align="center">***300+ Hacking Tools for All Debian Distro***</p>

Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux security distribution for those whose main concern is security – primarily, penetration testing, security auditing, forensics and reverse engineering. It has over 600 tools to aid in professional hacking. Though generally not used as an ‘everyday’ operating system, it is specifically engineered for professional pen testing and security auditing. As such, it is not for first-time Linux users.

But, what if you want to experiment with penetration testing or you just want a taste of Kali Linux tools but are not willing to leave the comfort of your operating system? What if you want the best of both worlds? This is where the ***Hacknix*** tool comes in handy.

***Hacknix*** is a script that installs all Kali Linux tools in your Debian-based operating system. All you need is Python 2.7 and the Git package installed in your system. Using this script, you can add and remove Kali Linux repositories..
